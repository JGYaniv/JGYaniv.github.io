# Consider a rectangle made up of WÃ—H square cells each with area 1.
# Each cell is independently coloured black with probability 0.5 otherwise white. Black cells sharing an edge are assumed to be connected.
# Consider the maximum area of connected cells.
#
# Define E(W,H) to be the expected value of this maximum area. For example, E(2,2)=1.875
#
# You are also given E(4,4)=5.76487732, rounded to 8 decimal places.
# Find E(7,7), rounded to 8 decimal places.
