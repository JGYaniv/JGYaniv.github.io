    <p>Hi world, this is my first blog post! Hope it's of some value to you dear reader!</p>
    <p>When designing this GitHub Pages blog, I wanted to have the list of articles generated on the client side.</p>
    <p>My idea was that I would use the JQuery Ajax method to call a JSON file with a list of all the blog post file names, and iterate through it appending the page with list items comprising each file's title and description. The problem when I implemented this methodology was that the posts would not appear in the correct order, in fact the order was constantly changing! This of course is because the JQuery functions are asynchronus and the list is populated in the order that they are loaded in stead of the order they appear in the JSON file.</p>
